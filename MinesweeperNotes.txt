Minesweeper Notes

want to implement:

- flagging system
    - place flag icon on button when right clicked

- first button always shows number
    - first click can't result in a loss

- winner screen
    - keep track of buttons pressed and complete game when all except bombs are pressed

- play again option
    - add a button to the side of grid guy that allows user to reset or play again
 
- welcome UI
    - asks for name, difficulty
    
- easy, medium, hard
    - solve by using var n to increase or decrease range of random

- bomb counter label
    - solve by an incrementing var every time bomb is made
    - show bomb counter as label in GridGui

- database for high scores
    - mysql
